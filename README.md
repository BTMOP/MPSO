This is the source code for the algorithm **Motion-Encoded Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO)**. The current implementation is for the optimal search of a lost target with the focus on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, it can be modified to apply to other optimization problems. Details of this algorithm can be found from the paper:
Manh Duong Phung, Quang Phuc Ha, *"Motion-encoded particle swarm optimization for moving target search using UAVs"*, Journal of Applied soft computing, in press.
